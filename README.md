# A spline fit to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> records from Antarctic ice cores and measured concentrations covering the past 25,000 years

This repository contains a netCDF (version 4) file containing a best-estimate of past atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations based on a spline fit through available ice core records and observations. For further technical details on the construction of th dataset, see the file ARVE_tech_report2_co2spline.pdf that is part of this repository.

Further details of the file format will be provided in future releases.
